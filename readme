This is a huge, and very interconnected game-mode. The content pack is large, and you could genuinely upload this to a server and it would be able to run from the get-go.
Some external things; the map uses stormfox2. Server uses serverguard. A lot of the stuff was still being worked on, especially in the addons. Some paid addons were not uploaded, for obvious reasons. A very small amount of NS integrations will thus not work, no I did not remove them.

No, I will not help you if you chose to use this. I am uploading this because I don't have the time to bring it to what I want it to be. I will continue working on it, but may not upload said changes.
I wish you good luck if you choose to work with this. There is a lot of good ideas and plugins, and even if you just want some of the features you will not be dissapointed.

Yes, I modified base nutscript. Not sorry to be honest, but there's nothing important that will break if you use normal NS. (I think)
