<h1>Contact Harvest Pt.2</h1>
<p>
The Corpsman swallowed dryly. "Yeah, I hear you."

"And from now on, my name is Staff Sergeant Johnson. Understood?"

"I got it." Healy grimaced and shifted to look out his window. He didn't need to say what else was on his mind; Avery clearly saw "I got it, a**hole," in the way he locked his arms across his chest.

As the sedan neared the end of the mall, Avery sped through an intersection past the imposing granite edifice of Harvest's parliament. The I-shaped building was surrounded by a low ironwork fence and well-manicured gardens. Its roof was thatched with sun-bleached wheat straw.

Avery had meant everything he said. But he also regretted it. He and Healy were essentially the same rank, but he'd just ordered him around like a raw recruit. And when did I become such a hypocrite? Avery wondered, tightening his grip on the wheel. His three-day bender back in the Zone wasn't the first time he'd ended up drunk in uniform.

Avery was preparing to deliver a terse apology when Healy muttered: "Oh, and Staff Sergeant Johnson? When you get a chance, pull over. Petty Officer First Class Healy needs to puke."

Three silent hours later, they were down the Bifrost and well out onto the Plain of Ida.

Epsilon Indi was setting in a pink and orange wash, above the perfectly straight, two-lane highway. Because of Harvest's small diameter, the horizon had a slight but noticeable curve—a bow in the fields of ripening wheat that had sprung up from the Ida after many hundreds of kilometers of fruit orchards. Avery had the sedan's windows down, and the air billowing through the cab was no longer unbearably hot. The Earth-relative UNSC military calendar said it was December. But on Harvest it was the height of summer—the middle of the growing season.

As the last of Epsilon Indi's rays slunk below the horizon, it got very dark very quickly.

There were no lights along the highway and no settlements in sight. Harvest had no moon, and while some of the system's four other planets shone unusually close, their reflected starshine wasn't enough to light the way ahead. As the sedan's headlamps came on, Avery spotted the exit marker and turned north off the highway.

The vehicle shuddered as it bit into the loose gravel of an upward sloping drive. A few gentle turns through the wheat and they reached a parade ground surrounded by very new, single-story polycrete buildings: mess hall, barracks, motor pool, and triage—the same rigid footprint Avery had seen many times before.

As he circled the sedan around the parade ground's flagpole, its headlights illuminated a man sitting on the mess hall steps, smoking a cigar. The scent wafting through the vehicle's windows was instantly recognizable: Sweet William, the preferred brand of pretty much every officer in the corps. When Avery brought the sedan to a stop and stepped out, he was quick to salute.

"At ease." Captain Ponder took a long drag from his cigar. "Johnson and Healy, correct?"

"Yes, sir!" the two soldiers replied together.

Ponder rose slowly from the steps. "Good to have you. Let me help you with your gear."

"That's alright, sir. Only got the two bags."

"Travel light, first to fight." The Captain smiled.

Adjusting for the steps, Avery could tell Ponder was a few inches shorter than he was, and a little less broad in the shoulders. He guessed the Captain's age was somewhere north of fifty.

But with his buzz-cut, salt-and-pepper hair, and well-tanned skin, he looked as vital as a man half his age, except for the fact that he was missing his right arm.

Avery noted that the sleeve of Ponder's fatigue shirt was cuffed to a phantom elbow and pinned neatly to his side. Then he stopped staring. He had seen plenty of amputees. But it was rare to meet an active-duty marine that wasn't fitted with a permanent prosthetic.

Ponder nodded toward the sedan. "Sorry about the civilian vehicle. Warthogs were supposed to be here a week ago. Shipping delay, if you can believe it. I've got my other platoon-leader in Utgard, trying to track them down."

"What about the recruits?" Avery asked, pulling the duffels from the sedan.

"Monday. We've got the whole weekend to set up shop."

Avery shut the trunk. As soon as he stepped away, the vehicle reversed around the flagpole and traced its furrows back down to the highway.

"Which platoon is mine?" Avery asked.

"First." Ponder pointed his cigar at one of the two barracks on the southern edge of the parade ground.

Healy hefted his duffel onto his shoulder. "You got me bunking with the grunts, sir?"

"Just until you clear a space in triage. Someone in logistics ordered a shitload of supplies.

Must have confused this garrison with some CSH on Tribute."

Healy chuckled. Avery did not; he was all too familiar with the kind of casualties a combat support hospital received.

"Mess hall dispensers are working if you want anything," the Captain continued.

"Otherwise, get some rest. I've scheduled a briefing for zero seven thirty to go over the training schedule—make sure we kick-off the first phase right."

"Anything else for tonight, sir?" Avery asked.

Ponder clamped his cigar tightly in his teeth. "Nothing that can't wait until morning."

Avery watched the ashen tip of Ponder's cigar flare in the darkness. Then he saluted, and marched off to the 1st platoon barracks, Healy trailing behind through the shifting gravel.

The Captain watched them traverse the pools of light cast by the parade ground's elevated arc lights. Some things, he knew, couldn't wait. Ponder tossed his cigar and ground it with his boot. Then he took his own path to his private quarters adjacent the motor pool.

Half an hour later, Avery was unpacked. All his gear was neatly stowed in a wall-locker in his platoon-leader's rack—a small room at the front of the barracks to one side of its screen- door entrance. He could hear Healy at the back of the barracks, still pulling items from his duffels—humming to himself as he arranged them on his bed.

"Hey. Staff Sergeant Johnson," the Corpsman shouted. "You got some soap?"

Avery gritted his teeth. "Check the showers."

As painful as it was to have Healy now taking pleasure in Avery's previous order—tossing his formality back in his face—the Staff Sergeant was glad he could hear the Corpsman through the walls of his room. Avery knew from experience that a large part of a drill instructor's job was simply keeping exhausted recruits from taking their frustrations out on one another—to be the focus of their anger, and, if he did his job right, their eventual admiration.

But Avery also knew that some days his platoon would return to the barracks pissed-off and itching for a fight precisely because he'd ground them down. At least he'd be able to hear any commotion from his rack and be able to break it up before things got out of hand.

"Look, it's only one night," Healy continued in a conciliatory tone. "If I can't get triage ship-shape tomorrow, I'll just bunk with what's his name."

"You mean the Captain?" Avery asked. He threw a brown wool blanket over his bed.

Regardless of the heat, he needed to show his recruits how to make a proper bed.

"No, the other platoon leader. Hang on, I'll check my COM."

Avery smoothed the blanket with wide sweeps of his palms. Then he started on the corners —tight hospital folds that would have made his own drill instructor proud.

"Byrne," Healy hollered. "Staff Sergeant Nolan Byrne."

Avery froze, his hands stuffed halfway under his mattress. The open coils of the bed frame bit into his palms.

"You know him?"

Avery completed the corner. He stood and reached for his pillow and case. "Yes."

"Huh. Did you know he was gonna be here?"

"No." Avery stuffed the pillow with a practiced thrust.

"You two friends?"

Avery wasn't quite sure how to answer that. "I've known him a long time."

"Oh, now I get it," Healy's voice changed pitch, signaling an incoming jibe. "You lovebirds start spending too much time together, and I might get jealous." Avery heard the Corpsman snicker then run the zipper of his duffel. "So what do you think the story is with the Captain's arm?"

But Avery didn't answer. He was focused on the loudening growl of a Warthog light- reconnaissance vehicle's engine as it raced up from the highway. The Warthog came to a hasty stop outside the barracks door. Its engine roared and died, and soon Avery heard the crunch of approaching boots.

Quickly, Avery paced to his locker, parted his neat piles of shirts and pants and removed a patent-leather belt with a bright brass buckle stamped with the UNSC eagle and globe emblem.

Behind him, the barrack's door swung open. Avery felt a chill on the back of his neck.

"That's a well made bed," Staff Sergeant Byrne said. "After a month in the hospital, you get an eye for that sort of thing."

Avery coiled his belt tight enough to hide it in the palm of his hand, shut the locker, and turned to face his former fellow squad-leader. Byrne no longer wore the helmet with the silver mirrored visor he'd had on the day Avery failed to shoot the Innie woman in the restaurant—the day Byrne had lost all the members of his squad. But he might as well have had it on. His ice- blue eyes were just as impenetrable.

"Because of all the changes," Byrne explained with a sneer. "Piss and shite all over the sheets because I was too doped to control myself. When the nurses gave me new ones, they'd always tuck them in too tight or not tight enough."

"It's good to see you, Byrne."

"But that?" Byrne continued, ignoring Avery's greeting. "That's a well-made bed."

Fresh, pink scars crinkled the Irish Staff Sergeant's already rugged face—evidence that his helmet's visor had shattered in the Innie blast. A jagged stitch from a shrapnel injury ran from his left temple up and over his ear. His black hair must have burned completely away; even though it was cut regulation short, Avery could see it was coming back in patches.

"I'm glad you're alright," Avery said.

"Are you now?" Byrne's brogue had begun to thicken. After years of soldiering together, Avery understood exactly what that meant. But he wanted Byrne to know one thing.

"They were all good men. I'm sorry."

Byrne shook his head. "Not sorry enough."

For such a large man, Byrne moved with amazing speed. He sprung at Avery, arms wide, and slammed him back against the locker. He locked his hands behind Avery's back and squeezed, threatening to break his ribs. As much as it hurt, Avery sucked in a breath and brought his forehead crashing down on Byrne's nose. Byrne grunted, his grip faltered, and he staggered back.

In a flash, Avery ducked around behind him, belt stretched between his hands. He looped it over Byrne's neck, and pulled it tight. Byrne's eyes widened. Avery wasn't trying to kill his fellow marine, just get him under control. Byrne outweighed him by at least twenty kilos, and Avery wanted him out for the count as quickly as possible.

But Byrne wasn't about to let that happen. With a strained but mighty cry he reached over his shoulders and grabbed Avery's wrists—leaned forward and brought Avery high on his back.

Then Byrne proceeded to slam Avery against the rooms wooden walls with such force that the painted plywood began to splinter.

Avery's teeth shuddered. He tasted blood in his mouth. But every time Byrne leaned forward for another backward thrust, Avery tightened his belt. Byrne began to wheeze. Avery could see the veins in his neck strain and his ears begin to purple. But an instant before Byrne lost consciousness, he brought the heel of his boot up between Avery's legs—right into his unprotected groin.

In the few seconds before he seized up, Avery hooked a foot around Byrne's shins and tripped him onto his bed. Byrne fell short, cracked his forehead on the bed frame, and went limp. As Avery rolled him over—raised a fist to finish the job—a debilitating ache spread from his groin to his arm. Byrne's eyes blinked, trying to clear away the blood flowing from a jagged cut, and Avery threw a half-speed punch. But Byrne was only dazed. He raised a massive hand, and caught Avery's fist in his iron grip.

"Why didn't you take the shot?" Byrne grunted.

"There were civilians," Avery groaned.

Byrne slammed his other palm up into Avery's gut, bunching his fatigue shirt in his fist.

With a powerful thrust of his hips, he flipped Avery over his shoulders toward the barrack's door. The air exploded from Avery's lungs as he landed flat on his back in the narrow hallway outside his rack.

"You had an order!" Byrne growled, rising to his feet.

Avery's chest heaved as he picked himself off the floor. "There was a kid; a boy."

"What about my team?!"

Byrne lumbered toward Avery and threw a high right jab. But Avery blocked it with his left forearm, and countered with a powerful, right-hand swipe. As Byrne's head snapped sideways, Avery brought a knee up into his kidneys. But Byrne collapsed against the blow, and drove him back against the hallway wall. Avery felt his left shoulder dislocate then pop back into place.

He blinked his eyes against the pain, giving Byrne an opening. The other Staff Sergeant quickly throttled him around the neck.

"They taught you to be a killer, Avery. They taught us both." Byrne slid him up the wall until his boots were twitching half a meter off the floor. The barrack's fluorescent lights seemed to dim, and Avery saw stars. He tried to kick himself free. But it was no use. "You can't hide from that," Byrne sneered. "And you sure as hell can't hide from me."

Avery was about to pass out when he heard the metallic snap of someone working a pistol's slide.

"Staff Sergeant Byrne." Captain Ponder said firmly. "Stand down."

Byrne tightened his grip on Avery's throat. "This is private business."

"Drop him, or I shoot."

"Bullshit."

"No, marine." The Captain's voice was deadly calm. "It most certainly is not."

Byrne released his hands. Avery dropped and slumped back against the wall. Gasping, he looked toward the barrack's door. The Captain held an M6 service pistol in a prosthetic replacement for his missing arm. Avery could see the bright titanium joints that were Ponder's fingers and the carbon-fiber weave of his forearm musculature.

"I know the numbers," Ponder said. "Thirty-eight civilian casualties, three of your unit KIA. But I also know Staff Sergeant Johnson is not in the stockade, nor was he charged with any misconduct. And as far as I'm concerned that's all anyone needs to know."

Byrne tightened his fists, but left them at his sides.

"You're angry. I understand that. But this ends tonight." Ponder shifted his gaze to Avery.

"You got anything else, now's the time."

"Sir, no sir." Avery's voice was hoarse.

Ponder's eyes snapped to Byrne. "And you?"

Without a moment's pause, Byrne smashed a fist into the side of Avery's face. Avery dropped to a knee. "That should do it," Byrne grunted.

Avery spat a mouthful of blood onto the barrack's floor. He hadn't run, but Byrne had followed—gotten transferred away from TREBUCHET just like him. Avery knew something wasn't right. And that filled him with more anger than any sucker punch.

"Last chance, Johnson" Ponder said.

Avery rose, and slugged Byrne hard enough to snap his head past his shoulder.

One of Byrne's teeth skipped along the floor and came to rest near Healy. The Corpsman had made his way forward from his bunk, hefting one of his boots like a club—apparently to try and break up the fight on his own. "Jesus," the Corpsman whispered, starring down at the tooth.

"We're finished." Ponder lowered his pistol. "That's an order."

"Yes, sir," Avery and Byrne said together.

The Captain gave each Staff Sergeant a final, emphatic glance, then marched down the barrack's steps. The screen-door banged shut behind him, creaked back on its hinges and came to a rattling rest.

"I'm not rated for oral surgery," Healy said lamely in the silence that followed. He knelt and picked up Byrne's tooth.

"Doesn't matter. What's done is done." Byrne locked Avery's wary stare. He sucked at the bloody hole of his missing canine. "But this is so I don't forget."

With a slow rotation of his massive frame, Byrne followed Ponder into the night.

"I'm going to triage," Healy announced.

"Good," Avery replied, rubbing his jaw. The way he felt, the last thing he wanted was Healy keeping him awake with more conversation.

"To grab a med-kit. Then I'm coming right back."

Avery huffed as Healy walked past, "You sure you still want to bunk with me?"

The Corpsman paused in the doorway. For the first time, Avery recognized the soothing appeal of his near-perpetual grin.

"You're a piece of work, Johnson." Healy jerked his chin at Byrne's fading footfalls. "But that guy? He'd probably kill me in my sleep."

CHAPTER SIX

MINOR TRANSGRESSION, EPSILON INDI SYSTEM

Dadab slunk through the engine room, doing his best to stay low in spite of his methane tank.

In his fist he held a rock, a mottled gray and green chunk of digestive grit he'd taken from the Kig-Yar's dining compartment. Easy now, he thought, rising up behind a thick line of conduit bracketed to the floor, don't spook it.

Scrub grubs were anxious creatures. The hairs that covered their turgid bodies were always in motion, sensing for danger as they ate their way around machinery that could easily scald or freeze. But it wasn't until Dadab rose up that it felt a disturbance in the room's steamy air. The grub pulled itself from the floor with a loud pop and began undulating for the safety of an elevated overflow unit, its consumption orifice warbling in miserable panic.

Dadab threw his rock, and the grub disappeared in a mealy poof. The rock carried forward, rebounded off the iridescent casing of Minor Transgression's engine, and skipped to a stop in a puddle of viscous green coolant. Had the grub lived, it eventually would have sucked the puddle up.

Dadab snorted proudly inside his mask, and flexed one of his hands: < Two! > < Apologies, but I am perplexed. > Lighter Than Some reached a pearly tentacle into the puddle, retrieved the rock, and tossed it back to Dadab. < I only saw one grub. > The Deacon rolled his small, red eyes. The rules of the game weren't complicated. He simply lacked the vocabulary to explain them clearly. < Watch > he signed.

Dadab wiped the rock clean with a corner of his orange tunic. Then with the pointed tip of one of his fingers, he scratched a second hash mark into the stone—right beside one for the first grub that had wandered into the methane suite, breaking a long stretch of mind-numbing confinement.

It had been many sleep cycles since Minor Transgression exited its jump at the edge of the unexplored alien system. Chur'R-Yar had moved inward at a cautious pace toward the alien cargo vessel's point of departure. But until they arrived, the Deacon had very little to do; Zhar and the other Kig-Yar crewman certainly weren't interested in listening to any of his sermons.

He showed the rock to Lighter Than Some, and signed his simple math:<One, one, two! > The docile grubs were hardly a challenge—nothing like the mud wasps and shade crabs of Dadab's youth. But in the Unggoy game of hunting rock, you marked every kill, easy or not.

< Oh, I see …. > the Huragok replied. < The amusement is additive. > < More … fun … ? > Dadab struggled to mimic poses for words he hadn't yet learned.

Lighter Than Some formed slow, simple poses. < More, kill, more, fun. > Dadab didn't take offense when the creature dumbed down its discourse for clarity. He knew he spoke no better than a Huragok infant and was grateful for its patience.

< Yes > Dadab gestured, < more, kill, more, fun. > He pulled a second rock from a pocket in his tunic and presented it to Lighter Than Some. < Most, kill, win! > But the Huragok ignored him—floated back to the conduit and began to fix a stress fracture that was the cause of the coolant puddle.

Dadab knew the creature had a preternatural urge to repair things. It was almost impossible to distract it from its work, which was why Huragok were such valuable crew members. With a Huragok on board, nothing remained broken for long. Indeed, seconds later the leak was sealed —the tear in the metal conduit knitted together by the cilia that covered the tips of Lighter Than Some's tentacles.

< Hunt! > Dadab said, offering the rock a second time.

< I'd rather not. > < Why?> < Really, you go ahead. Try for three. > < Game, fun! > < No, your game is murder. > Dadab couldn't help an exasperated groan. A grub was a grub! There were hundreds of the things skulking around the Kig-Yar ship! On a long voyage like this one, it was essential to thin their numbers before they multiplied and worked their way into a critical system.

Then again, Dadab thought, maybe the Huragok felt a certain kinship with his prey? They were both voiceless servants—tireless slaves to the Kig-Yar vessel's needs. Dadab imagined Lighter Than Some's beady sensory nodes glimmering with condemnation.

Looking around the engine-room, Dadab spotted a spent energy core. He hefted the clear, bowed cube onto the overflow unit the grub was aiming for and worked it back and forth until it balanced nicely—until he was sure the Huragok would tip it, even with a glancing blow.

< Now, no, kill. > Dadab signed enthusiastically. < Just, fun! > Lighter Than Some deflated one of its gas-sacs with an obstinate toot.

< Try! > Dadab pleaded. < Just, once! > With obvious disdain, the Huragok curled its tentacle and tossed its rock. It was a perfunctory throw, but it hit the core dead center, knocking it to the floor.

< One! > Dadab grunted happily and was about to reset the target for another toss when the Shipmistress' voice crackled from a round metal signal unit clipped to his tank harness.

"Deacon, to the bridge. And do not bring the Huragok."

Chur'R-Yar sat at the edge of her command-chair, mesmerized by the contents of the bridge's holo-tank. The representation of the alien system was now much more detailed. Planets and asteroids—even an inbound comet—were all represented, details previously missing from Minor Transgression's database. The planet from which the alien ship began its journey shone in the very center of the tank. But it was the thousands of cyan glyphs dotting the planet's surface—all with the same, circular design—that transfixed her.

Suddenly, the glyphs and everything inside the tank flickered as it temporarily lost power.

"Careful!" the Shipmistress hissed, twisting toward Zhar. The male Kig-Yar stood near an alcove in the bridge's concave purple walls, a laser-cutter in one of his clawed hands.

"I want it disconnected, not destroyed!"

"Yes, Mistress." Zhar's spines flattened subserviently on his head. Then he gingerly reapplied his cutter to a twist of circuits connected to a device with three pyramidal parts suspended in the center of the alcove. The largest of the pyramids was arranged point down; the two smaller ones pointed up, supporting the largest on either side. All three shone with a silver glow that framed Zhar against the alcove.

This was the ship's Luminary, an arcane device required on all Covenant vessels. It had assigned thousands of glyphs or Luminations to the alien world, each one a possible Forerunner relic. Chur'R-Yar's tongue flicked against her teeth with barely contained excitement. If only Minor Transgression had a bigger hold….

The Shipmistress came from a long line of matriarchal ship captains. And while most of her bloodline had been decimated in defense of asteroid redoubts during the Covenant's aggressive conversion of her species into its faith, she still felt her ancestors' buccaneering spirit pulsing through her veins.

Kig-Yar had always been pirates. Long before the Covenant arrived, they sailed the tropical archipelagos of their watery home world, raiding competing clans for food and mates. As their populations grew, the distances and differences between clans decreased; a new cooperative spirit led to the creation of spacecraft that lifted them from their planet. But as some clans looked out on the dark and endless sea of space, they could not resist returning to their old marauding ways.

In the end, these pirates were the species' only effective resistance to the Covenant. But they could not hold out forever. To save themselves, the captains were forced to accept letters of marque: agreements that let them keep their ships so long as they sailed in the service of a Covenant Ministry.

Some Kig-Yar saw opportunity in this subservience. Chur'R-Yar saw eons of table scraps.

Endless patrols, looking for relics—unimaginably valuable treasures she would never be allowed to claim as her own. Yes, during her voyages she might stumble across some small amount of salvage: a derelict Covenant habitat or a damaged alien freighter. But these were comparatively meager alms, and Chur'R-Yar was no beggar.

At least not anymore, she thought. The Shipmistress knew she could remove a small number of relics without anyone noticing. But only if her ship's Luminary remained silent, and she waited to transmit its accounting until after she had taken her share.

Chur'R-Yar felt the callused plates on her neck and shoulders contract. This thick skin served as natural armor, keeping females of her species safe during the literal backbiting that accompanied most Kig-Yar mating sessions. The Shipmistress wasn't normally very broody.

But when she sold the relics on the Covenant black-market, she hoped to earn enough profit to take Minor Transgression out of service for an entire mating season. And that possibility was deeply arousing.

She relaxed in her chair and stared at Zhar—watched his sinewy muscles ripple beneath his scales—as he carefully severed the Luminary's connections to her ship's signal circuits. He wasn't her ideal mate. She would have preferred someone with higher standing amongst the clans, but she had always been partial to males with virile plumage. And Zhar had another advantage: he was close at hand. With all the blood rushing to her shoulders, Chur'R-Yar began to feel deliciously faint.

But then the bridge door cycled open, and Dadab trotted through. The Unggoy's tunic reeked of engine coolant and gassy Huragok, and the stink immediately killed her libido.

"Shipmistress?" Dadab preformed a curt bow then looked suspiciously at Zhar.

"What do you see?" Chur'R-Yar snapped, redirecting the Unggoy's gaze toward the holo- tank.

"A system. Single star. Five planets." Dadab took a step toward the tank. "One of the planets seems … to … have …" His voice squeaked off, and he drew a series of rapid breaths.

Chur'R-Yar clucked her tongue. "A Luminary does not lie."

Usually she quoted Holy Writs only to mock them, but this time Chur'R-Yar was serious.

Every Luminary was modeled after a device the Prophets had located aboard an ancient Forerunner warship—one that now stood at the center of the Covenant capitol, High Charity.

Luminaries were sacred objects and tampering with them was punishable by death—or worse.

Which was why the Shipmistress knew the Deacon was so distressed by Zhar's actions. As her chosen mate continued to flash his laser all around the Luminary, the Deacon shifted his weight from one of his conical, flat-bottomed feet to the other. Chur'R-Yar could hear the valves inside his mask clicking as he tried to get his breathing under control.

"I must report these Luminations at once," Dadab gasped.

"No," the Shipmistress snapped. "You will not."

Zhar severed a final circuit and the Luminary dimmed.

"Heresy!" Dadab wailed, before he could stay his tongue.

Zhar clattered his toothy jaws and stepped toward the Deacon, laser cutter blazing. But Chur'R-Yar stopped the over-protective male with a rattling hiss. Under different circumstances, she might have let him tear the Unggoy apart for his foolish insult. But for now, she needed him alive.

"Calm yourself," she said. "The Luminary is not damaged. It simply cannot speak."

"But the Ministry!" Dadab stammered. "It will demand an explanation—"

"And it shall have one. After I take my pick of plunder."

The Shipmistress uncurled a claw toward the holo-tank. There was a single glyph not located on the alien planet. To the untrained eye, it might have looked like some sort of display error—a misplaced piece of data. But Chur'R-Yar's pirate gaze recognized it for what it was: a relic aboard another of the alien freighters; one she hoped would be as easy to capture as the first.

The Deacon was shivering now, his whole blue-gray body quaking with terror. The Shipmistress knew the Unggoy was right: what she planned to do was heresy. Only the Prophets were allowed access to relics. And if tampering with a Luminary meant death, defying the Prophets meant damnation.

Then suddenly the Deacon calmed. Eyes darting between the glyphs in the holo-tank and the bright red tip of Zhar's laser cutter, his breathing slowed. Chur'R-Yar knew the Unggoy was smarter than most and guessed he had just realized the full extent his predicament: the Shipmistress had told him her secret plans, and yet he lived. Which could only mean one thing: She had a plan for him.

"What would my Shipmistress have me do?" Dadab asked. Chur'R-Yar's teeth glittered in the Luminary's weakened light. "I need you to lie."

The Deacon nodded. And the Shipmistress set course for the relic-laden ship.

Henry "Hank" Gibson loved his freighter—loved her big, ugly lines and the quiet rumble of her Shaw-Fujikawa drive. Most of all he loved to sail her, which most people thought was a little unusual when a NAV computer could do just as well. But that was fine by Hank because, even more than his ship, he loved not giving a damn what people thought of him, something to which either of his ex-wives would gladly attest.

Human ship captains weren't uncommon in the UNSC commercial fleet; they just mainly sailed cruise ships and other passenger vessels. Hank had worked for one of the big cruise companies—served on the luxury liner Two Drink Minimum nonstop from Earth to Arcadia for the better part of fifteen years, the last five as first mate.

But the liner had needed all kinds of computer assistance to get from A to B while keeping its hundreds of passengers well fed and rested. Hank was a self-avowed loner, and it didn't matter if the voices talking to him were human or simulated—he liked a quiet bridge. And Two Drink Minimum's certainly wasn't that. If the pay hadn't been so good, and the time away from his wives so therapeutic, Hank would have quit a whole lot sooner.

Other than astrogation (the coordination of Slipspace jumps that required a NAV computer), a freighter captain could handle as many of his ship's normal space operations as he liked. Hank loved having his hands on the controls—blasting away with his hydrazine rockets as he bullied thousands of tons of cargo in and out of a planet's gravity well. The fact that he owned his ship, This End Up, made sailing her even sweeter. It had taken all his savings, painful renegotiations of his alimonies, and a loan so large he didn't like to think about it, but now he was his own boss. He got to pick what he hauled and over time he built up a list of customers who were willing to pay a little extra for personalized service.

One of his most reliable customers was JOTUN Heavy Industries, a Mars-based firm specializing in the construction of semi-autonomous farm machinery. His freighter's hold was currently filled with a prototype of their next series of plows—massive machines designed to till wide swaths of earth. The things were incredibly expensive, and Hank assumed a prototype would be even more so. Which was why, staring at a console filled with flashing warning lights, he was more angry than afraid.

This End Up's unknown attacker had hit while the ship was hurtling toward Harvest on a high-speed intercept vector. Hank survived the attack unharmed. But the hostile fire had ruined his Shaw-Fujikawa drive, fried his maneuvering rockets and maser—caused more damage to This End Up than he could afford to repair. Piracy was unheard of on the routes Hank ran, and he had never even considered adding the optional, extremely expensive coverage to his policy.

Hank slapped his hand on the console, silencing a new alarm: hull breach, port side of the cargo container, close to the stern. He could feel the rubberized floor of the command cabin vibrate as something worked its way through the hull.

"God damn it!" Hank cursed, wrenching a fire extinguisher from a wall bracket. He hoped the pirates wouldn't damage the JOTUN prototype as they cut their way inside.

"Fine. These jerks wanna break my ship?" Hank snarled, hefting the extinguisher above his head. "Then they're gonna buy it."

The interior of Minor Transgression's umbilical glowed red as its penetrator tip burned into the alien vessel. Through the semi-transparant walls, Dadab could see laser scarring on the vessel's propulsion unit—black slash-marks from Chur'R-Yar's comprehensive crippling.

How can she be so calm?! Dadab groaned, looking down the umbilical at the Shipmistress.

She stood behind Zhar, one clawed hand resting on the grip of her holstered plasma-pistol— like a Kig-Yar pirate queen of old—poised for boarding action. The other two Kig-Yar crewmen standing just behind her were less composed. Both of them fiddled with their energy cutlasses: pink crystal shards used as melee weapons. Dadab wondered if the crewmen, like him, realized they were doomed.

He imagined Chur'R-Yar would succeed in removing the relic (though some had proven to be quite dangerous, even in the Prophets' deft hands). Then she would probably jump right into the thick of Covenant space—where her relic would show as one of countless others—and quickly find a buyer before raising any Ministry suspicions. It was a plausible plan. But Dadab knew he and any other unnecessary witnesses would be dead long before it was completed. In his case, immediately after he transmitted a false accounting of the number of Luminations in the alien system.

The umbilical dimmed as its penetrator tip finished its burn through the hull. The end of the passage irised open to reveal a shimmering energy field.

"Have the Huragok check the pressure," Chur'R-Yar said, glancing back at Dadab.

The Deacon turned and signed to Lighter Than Some behind him: < Check, air, equal. > Before they boarded the alien vessel, they needed to be sure there was a balance between the umblilical's atmosphere and that of the ship's hold. If there wasn't, they might be torn apart as they passed through the field.

The Huragok floated nonchalantly past Dadab. For Lighter Than Some, this was just another opportunity to be helpful. It checked the sensors governing the field and loosed a satisfied bleat. Zhar wasted no time jumping through.

"It is safe!" the Kig-Yar male announced via his signal unit. Chur'R-Yar motioned the other male crewmen forward, then slipped through the field followed closely by Lighter Than Some.

Dadab took a deep breath and offered a silent prayer for the Prophets' forgiveness. Then he too passed into the alien vessel.

Its hold wasn't nearly as packed as the first one they'd encountered. Instead of floor-to- ceiling containers of fruit, the space was dominated by a single piece of cargo: a towering machine with six massive wheels. On the front of the machine was a beam—wider than the machine itself—fitted with toothlike spikes, each twice as tall as Dadab. Most of the machine's internal parts were shrouded by yellow and blue painted metal, but here and there Dadab saw exposed circuits and pneumatics. Above the toothed beam were a series of raised, bright metal symbols: J-O-T-U-N.

Dadab cocked his head. If the symbols were Forerunner, he hadn't ever seen them. But he wasn't too surprised; he was just a lowly Deacon, and there were countless holy mysteries he had yet to understand.

"Tell the Huragok to investigate," Chur'R-Yar snapped, pointing at the machine.

Dadab clapped his paws together to get Lighter Than Some's attention: < Find, relic! > The Huragok ballooned the largest of its sacs, increasing its buoyancy. As it rose above one of the machine's large wheels, it vented a smaller chamber, propelling itself through a curtain of multicolored wires.

The Shipmistress directed Zhar and the two other crewmen to a pile of plastic crates strapped to the floor near the back of the vehicle. Eagerly clattering their bony jaws, the Kig- Yar leapt to their task, prying open the topmost boxes with quick jabs and swift pulls of their claws. Soon they disappeared in a flurry of soft, white packing material.

"Make yourself useful, Deacon," Chur'R-Yar snapped. "Collect the vessel's signal unit."

Dadab bowed and scampered around the machine to the rear of the hold. The elevator platform worked the same as before, and soon he was rising up to the passage that led to the command cabin. Halfway down the passage, the Deacon suddenly remembered the disgusting filth that had awaited him last time. As he stepped through the cabin door, he involuntarily held his breath and shut his eyes.

Clang! Something heavy slammed into Dadab's tank. He yelped with alarm and staggered forward. Another blow knocked him to his stomach. Methane hissed from a fracture in his tank.

"Have mercy!" Dadab shrieked, curling into a ball and covering his face with his spiny forearms. He heard a series of guttural exclamations, and felt something kick the back of one of his legs. Dadab parted his arms ever so slightly, and peeked through the crack.

The alien was tall and muscular. Most of its pale flesh was covered by a fitted cloth jumpsuit. Teeth bared, and holding a red metal cylinder above its mostly hairless head, the thing looked savage—not at all like something that might possess a holy relic.

The alien lashed out with one of its heavy boots, striking Dadab's leg a second time. It shouted more angry and unintelligible words.

"Please!" Dadab whimpered, "I don't understand!" But his pleas only seemed to anger the alien. It stepped forward, cudgel raised for a killing blow. Dadab shrieked and covered his eyes….

But the blow never came. Dadab heard the cylinder bounce off the rubbery floor, and roll to a stop against the side of the cabin. Slowly, the Deacon uncrossed his arms.

The alien's mouth was open but it didn't speak. It teetered back and forth, grasping for its head. Then all at once, its arms slacked. Dadab scooted backward as the alien careened face- first onto the floor right between his legs. He heard a nervous bleat and looked up.

Lighter Than Some floated in the cabin's doorway. Three of its tentacles were tucked defensively close to its sacs. The fourth stuck straight out, quivering in what Dadab initially took for fear. But then he realized Lighter Than Some was trying to speak—struggling to form the simplest Huragok sign: &lt; One.&gt; A clamor of clawed feet in the passage heralded the Ship-mistress' approach. She shoved past the Huragok brandishing her plasma-pistol and cocked one of her ruby eyes at the alien's corpse. "How did it die?" she asked.

Dadab looked down. The back of the alien's skull was caved in—punctured with a ragged hole. Gingerly Dadab slipped two fingers inside the mortal wound. He pinched something hard in the center of the thing's brains, and pulled it out for all to see: Lighter Than Some's hunting rock.

Sif didn't like to upset her NAV computer charges. Somewhere deep in her core logic was a memory of her maker as a harried mother with little patience for her infant child. But communicating with ships while they were in Slipspace was impossible. So there was no way for Sif to give them forewarning of the additional security measures Jilan al-Cygni had imposed after the audit.

<\\> HARVEST.SO.AI.SIF >> DCS.CUP#-00040370 <\ ADHERE TO YOUR NEW TRAJECTORY.

<\ MAINTAIN REQUIRED SPEED.

<\ ALL IS WELL. \> To connect with Harvest, or any other planet, as it hurtled through the void, freighters needed to exit Slipspace on the right trajectory, traveling at match speed. Harvest orbited Epsilon Indi at a little more than one hundred fifty thousand kilometers per hour, faster than most UNSC worlds. Depending on the angle of its intercept vector, a NAV computer might have to push its ship even faster than that to make the rendezvous.

So the NAV computers were understandably rattled when, immediately after exiting their jumps, Sif demanded they prepare to meet Harvest further along its orbit.

Sif severed her connection to the freighter, Contents Under Pressure, and answered another hail. Various parts of her mind were communicating with hundreds of freighters at once, assuring their simple circuits that the holds she was imposing were perfectly safe and legal. The same message, over and over again.

The algorithms that guided Sif's emotions advised her not to correlate repetition with annoyance. But her core couldn't help feeling a little vexed. The woman from DCS had insisted on double-checking the ARGUS and other data she collected from all freighters entering the system. Sif knew this was all part of her probation—that she needed to endure a little bureaucratic humiliation before the DCS would forgive her oversight.

Fortunately, al-Cygni was both polite and efficient, and turned around her sign-offs on Sif's surveys very quickly. But she was human, and needed to sleep at least a few hours every day.

That meant some freighters had to stick in holding patterns for quite some time. And this made their NAV computers even more anxious….

<\\> HARVEST.SO.AI.SIF >> DCS.TEU#-00481361 <\ ATTENTION, THIS END UP. <\ YOU MUST MAINTAIN REQUIRED SPEED.

Sif could tell This End Up was still on the right trajectory, but it had begun to slow. The decrease was minor (less than five-hundred meters per minute) but any deceleration was unacceptable when the goal was keeping pace with a planet.

<\ THIS END UP, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

<\ CONTACT HARVEST ON ANY CHANNEL. \> But there was no response, and Sif knew the freighter would surely miss its rendezvous.

She had just begun to contemplate the myriad of problems that could have caused This End Up to lose its speed when, without warning, the freighter disappeared from her scan. Or more specifically, the single contact that was This End Up suddenly turned into many hundreds of millions of smaller contacts.

Or more succinctly, Sif decided, the ship blew up.

She checked the time. It was well past midnight. As she initiated a COM with al-Cygni's hotel in Utgard, she wondered if the woman was still awake.

"Good morning, Sif. How can I help you?" Jilan al-Cygni sat at her suite's desk. From the hotel's full-color feed, Sif could see the woman wore the same brown pantsuit from their previous meeting. But it looked perfectly pressed and al-Cygni's long black hair was tightly wound. Peering into the background, Sif noted that her bed hadn't been disturbed.

"Anything wrong?" al-Cygni asked in a tone that confirmed her alertness.

"We've lost another ship," Sif said, beaming all the relevant data down her maser.

She noted a fractional lowering of al-Cygni's shoulders, a slight unclenching of her jaw. Far from being surprised, the announcement seemed to settle the woman—as if she'd been expecting the freighter's loss and had been waiting for Sif to relay the news.

"Name and itinerary?" Jilan asked, her fingers reaching for her COM pad.

"This End Up. Mars via Reach."

"There were more than thirty ships on proximate vectors," Jilan mused. She scrolled a finger slowly across the screen—trying to discover useful patterns in Sif's data. "Why that one in particular?"

This End Up's manifest claimed it was carrying a JOTUN prototype. Until Sif's ARGUS delivered its assessment of the expanding cloud of debris, she had no hard evidence this wasn't the case. Checking the data on other nearby freighters, she confirmed most were loaded with consumer goods. Some carried replacement parts for JOTUNs and other farm machinery. But just as Sif was about to mention the JOTUN prototype as the only significant difference between the various cargos, she noticed something else unusual about the freighter.

But then she saw Jilan's lips begin to move, and as protocol demanded, she held her virtual tongue. It was insolent and prideful to cut a human off, her algorithims reminded her. So Sif did her best not to feel miffed as al-Cygni took credit for their shared realization. The woman's green eyes sparkled as she explained: "This End Up was the only ship with a captain. An actual human crew."

CHAPTER SEVEN

HARVEST, JANUARY 16, 2525

As soon as the 1st platoon's recruits had bussed their breakfast trays into the mess hall's sanitizer, Avery led them on their daily march: ten kilometers out and back along the Gladsheim Highway. After two weeks of physical training (PT), they were used to the route—a devastatingly dull path through the flat fields of wheat. But until today they had never done it with full twenty-five kilogram rucksacks. And by the time Epsilon Indi was blazing in the mid- morning sky, the march had become a uniquely punishing ordeal.

This was true for Avery as well, who hadn't gotten any decent exercise since before his trip back home. The long stretches of cryo-sleep from Epsilon Eridanus to Sol and then from Sol to Epsilon Indi had left him with a condition commonly known as "freezer burn." This agonizing sensation, like a bad case of pins and needles, was caused by the breakdown of cryo-sleep pharmaceuticals trapped in muscles and joints, and Avery's case was the worst he'd ever felt—a deep prickling pain in his knees and shoulders brought on by the strenuous march.

Avery winced as he removed his ruck. But it was easy to hide his discomfort from his platoon, because the thirty-six men huddled around the parade-ground flagpole were focused on their own exhaustion. Sweat running down his nose and chin, Avery watched as one of them vomited his jostled breakfast. This started a chain reaction that soon had almost half the platoon heaving loudly onto the gravel.

Jenkins, a younger recruit with rust-colored hair, was doubled over directly in front of Avery. Thin arms resting on his knees, he made a sound that was half cough, half cry. Avery saw a string of spittle stretch toward his poorly tied boots. He's gonna have blisters, Avery frowned, staring at the loose laces. But he also knew Jenkins faced a more immediate and dangerous threat: dehydration.

He pulled a plastic water bottle from his ruck and thrust it into the recruit's shaking hands.

"Drink it slow."

"Yes, Staff Sergeant," Jenkins wheezed. But he didn't move.

"Now, recruit!" Avery barked.

Jenkins straightened—so quickly that the shifting weight of his ruck almost tossed him back on his bony behind. His shrunken cheeks swelled as he unscrewed the bottle and took two big gulps.

"I said slow," Avery tried to keep his anger in check. "Or you're gonna cramp."

Avery knew the colonial militia wasn't the marines, but it was difficult for him to lower his expectations for his recruits' performance. About half of them were members of Harvest's law enforcement and other emergency services, so they were at least mentally prepared for the rigors of basic training. But these men were older as well (some in their late forties or early fifties), and they weren't all in the best of shape.

Things weren't much better with the younger recruits like Jenkins. Most of them had grown up on farms, but because Harvest's JOTUNs did all the hard manual labor, they were just as physically unprepared as their elders to learn the strenuous craft of soldiery.

"Healy!" Avery shouted, pointing to Jenkins' boots. "Got a pair of bad feet!"

"That makes three!" the Corpsman shot back. He was handing out water bottles to a pair of paunchy, middle-aged recruits with sunburned faces. "Dass and Abel are so fat, I think they wore right through their socks." The corpsman had raised his voice loud enough for the whole platoon to hear, and a few of the men who hadn't lost their breakfasts (and their sense of humor along with it) chuckled quietly at Healy's inane accusation.

Avery scowled. He couldn't decide what made him more upset: the fact that Healy insisted on clowning around, ruining the no-nonsense mood he was trying to set; or that the corpsman already knew every recruit's name while Avery still had to check the name tape on the chest pockets of their olive-drab fatigue shirts.

"You got the energy to talk? You got the energy to walk!" Avery snapped. "Get some water.

Suck it down. All I want to hear is the sound of hydration. Which—to be clear—sounds like ab- so-lutely nothing at all!"

Immediately, thirty-six clear plastic bottles tipped skyward. Jenkins was especially eager to keep his sore feet where they were and guzzled his water at an alarming rate. Avery watched the recruit's oversized Adam's apple bob up and down like a yoyo on a very short string. The kid can't even follow an order about drinking properly.

The sound of voices on the garrison drive announced the return of Byrne and 2nd platoon.

Avery could hear them calling cadence—shouting a Marine Corps marching chant. Byrne bellowed each line and his recruits repeated: When I die please bury me deep!

Place an MA5 down by my feet!

Don't cry for me, don't shed no tear!

Just pack my box with PT gear!

'Cuz one early morning 'bout zero-five!

The ground will rumble, there'll be lightning in the sky!

Don't you worry, don't come undone!

It's just my ghost on a PT run!

As 2nd platoon crested the top of the drive and shuffled into the parade ground, the screen door to Captain Ponder's quarters swung open. As usual, the Captain had chosen not to wear his prosthetic; the sleeve of his fatigue shirt was once again pinned neatly to his side.

"Atten-shun!" Avery barked.

Ponder gave 1st platoon a chance to straighten up, and 2nd platoon time to come to a gasping stop. Then he asked in a loud but friendly voice: "You men enjoy your stroll?"

"Sir, yes sir," the recruits answered with varied enthusiasm.

Ponder turned to Byrne. "They don't sound too sure, Staff Sergeant."

"No, they don't," Byrne snarled.

"Maybe ten klicks wasn't long enough for them to make up their minds …"

"I'd be happy to run them again, Captain."

"Well, let me make sure." Ponder put his fist on his hip and shouted: "I say again, did you all enjoy your stroll?"

All seventy-two recruits shouted at once. "Sir, yes sir!"

"Do it again tomorrow?"

"Sir, yes sir!"

"Now I definitely heard that! At ease!" As the recruits got back to aching, Ponder waved Avery over. "How was their pace?"

"Not bad, considering their load."

"What's the plan for this afternoon?"

"Thought I might take them out to the range."

Ponder nodded his head approvingly. "About time we let them punch a few targets. But you'll need to hand them off to Byrne. We've got a date."

"Sir?"

"Solstice Celebration. Utgard. Governor of this fine planet extended an invitation to me and one of my Staff Sergeants." The Captain jutted his chin toward Byrne, currently unleashing a string of expletives at a terrified recruit who had just made the mistake of losing his breakfast directly on the Staff Sergeant's boots. "It's a formal affair. Ladies in long dresses, that sort of thing." Ponder smiled at Avery. "I have a feeling you'll be a better fit."

"Roger that." The last thing Avery wanted to do was field questions about the Insurrection from a bunch of boozy politicians, but as he watched Byrne order the recruit to start doing push-ups directly over his vomit-covered boots, he had to admit: the Captain was probably right.

And besides, there were questions Avery wanted to ask Ponder—first and foremost, why he and Byrne had been transferred to Harvest. Since the night of their fight in the barracks, the two Staff Sergeants hadn't exactly been on speaking terms, so Avery had gotten no information from Byrne. During the ride to Utgard, he hoped the Captain could explain why the UNSC had seen fit to transfer two TREBUCHET team-leaders—take them off the frontline of the Insurrection.

Avery had a strong suspicion that he wasn't going to like Ponder's answer.

"Party starts at zero six-thirty." The Captain turned back to his quarters. "Clean yourself up, meet me at the motor pool ASAP."

Avery snapped a hasty salute, then strode back to his recruits. "Forsell, Wick, Andersen, Jenkins!" he boomed, reading their names from his COM pad. Four sets of shoulders set a little straighter. "Says here none of you have ever handled a weapon. Is that correct?"

"Yes, Staff Sergeant." The recruits' replies were halting, embarrassed. Some of the older militiamen, constables who were used to carrying small-caliber sidearms for their work, snickered at the recruits inexperience.

"Won't be so funny when they're standing behind you in a firefight," Avery growled.

The constables' laughter quickly died.

Avery motioned for Jenkins and the others to gather round. "The Captain and I have an appointment in town. So Staff Sergeant Byrne's going to get you all snapped in."

The recruits looked blankly at one another, confused by Avery's shorthand.

"He's gonna teach you how to shoot," Avery clarified. "Try not to shoot each other."

An hour later, he was behind the wheel of a Warthog, speeding east on the Gladsheim highway with Captain Ponder in the passenger seat beside him. With Epsilon Indi beating down directly overhead, Avery was unusually glad of the vehicle's stripped-down design. In a war zone, the Warthog's lack of roof and doors made it a dangerous ride. But when the only enemy you faced was the sweaty cling of a navy-blue dress uniform, its open-air passenger compartment was an absolute blessing.

To help keep themselves cool, both men had removed their navy-blue dress coats and rolled their shirtsleeves to their elbows. Ponder opted to keep his false arm covered; Avery guessed because the prosthetic's titanium joints would get uncomfortably warm in the direct sunlight.

Out of the corner of his eye he saw the Captain reach up and scratch his shoulder, massaging the nano-fiber junction where the circuits met the man.

For some time Avery and Ponder sat in silence and watched the wheat fields around the garrison give way to vast peach and apple orchards. Avery wasn't sure how best to break the ice. He didn't just want to come out and ask: "Why am I here?" He guessed there was a good reason why the Captain was keeping the information secret and suspected it would take a little more finesse to draw his answer out. So he started with something simple.

"Sir. If you don't mind me asking, what happened to your arm?

"M-EDF 9/21/1," Ponder replied, raising his voice above the Warthog's roar. "You familiar with the unit?"

Avery automatically parsed the code: ninth marine expeditionary force, twenty-first division, 1st battalion. It was one of the many units serving in Epsilon Eridanus.

"Yes, sir. Hard-ass grunts."

"That they were." The Captain reached two of his pros-thetic's metal fingers into his shirt pocket and retrieved a Sweet William cigar. "I used to be their CO."

Avery tightened his grip on the steering wheel as a hauler blew by in the opposite direction.

"What sort of action did you see?" He did his best to keep a casual tone. But if what Ponder said was true, that meant he was a critical part of the UNSC's fight against the Insurrection— that his presence on Harvest was just as odd as Avery and Byrne's.

"Let's not beat around the bush, Staff Sergeant. TRE-BUCHET. It's in your file. Byrne's too. And I've spent the last two weeks wondering the exact same thing." The Captain bit the tip off his cigar. "Why would the Corps send two of its meanest sons-of-bitches way out here?"

"I was hoping you might shed some light on that, sir."

"Hell if I know." Ponder removed a silver lighter with a hinged top from his pants pocket, cracked it open, and began stoking his cigar. "FLEETCOM hasn't been all that free with information …" he said between puffs. Then, snapping the lighter shut: "Since they gave me a demotion."

Something clicked in Avery's head. Of course, he thought, the CO of a Marine battalion would be at least a Lt. Colonel—two pay grades higher than Ponder's current Captain rank. But Avery had no idea what this meant with respect to the larger question. If anything, Ponder's revelation made things even more confusing. "Demotion, sir?" he asked, treading water.

"I lost my arm," Ponder began, "in Elysium City, Eridanus II." He put one of his boots up on the dash. "This was back in 'thirteen. Watts and his gang were just starting to show their teeth."

Colonel Robert Watts—or "that bastard" to most UNSC personnel—was a Marine Corps officer born and raised in Epsilon Eridanus who had defected to the Insurrectionist's side early in the war. He and the group of turncoats he commanded were one of TREBUCHET's priority targets. So far, no one had gotten a decent shot at him, though Avery had once come close.

"We were hoping to capture Watts' second in command," Ponder continued, taking a long drag on his cigar. "Admirals at FLEETCOM wanted my battalion to go in strong—plenty of armor and air support. Intimidate the locals into giving the guy up without a fight. But the town was still fifty-fifty. Not everyone was on the Innies' side, and I thought a little restraint might help win some hearts and minds."

Avery grunted. "Must have been before my time."

"Things were different in the beginning. There was still time to talk—a chance for peace."

Ponder shook his head. "Anyhow this guy—my target—had married the daughter of one of the local officials. I thought the father-in-law would be pretty ticked when a whole armored column showed up on his doorstep. But the next thing I knew, I was in his living room, sipping tea."

Ponder tapped the ash from his cigar. "We talked about nothing for a few minutes—just got comfortable. Then when his wife was pouring me a second cup, I got down to it: 'We're looking for so-and-so, do you know where we can find him, we don't mean your daughter any harm, etcetera, etcetera.' And he looks me right in the eye …" Ponder paused and stared out the Warthog's sloped windshield. "He looks me in the eye and says: 'Someday we will win. No matter what it takes.'" The Captain flexed his prosthetic, pantomiming his memories. "Then he put his arm around the target's wife—his own daughter—and raised it up like this … took me a second to realize he had a grenade."

Avery didn't know what to say, except that, having inherited the Insurrection from men like Ponder, he'd seen things at least as surprising, at least as tragic.

"I knew it was a bluff. This guy was dedicated to the cause, no doubt. But kill his whole family? Wasn't gonna happen." Ponder pulled the half-smoked cigar from his teeth and ground it into the dash. "One of my snipers thought different. Put a hasty round through the wall of his house, tore the guy in half. But he pulled the pin on reflex." The Captain shrugged. "I dove to cover the blast. Things got worse from there."

Tight space, jumpy soldiers; Avery knew worse had meant a lot of civilian casualties, some very angry top brass and—adding insult to injury—Ponder taking a two-step drop in rank.

"I think they wanted me to take an early retirement. But I stuck with it," the Captain said.

"Took a bunch of lousy billets and worked my way up to CMT. Thought I'd left the Insurrection behind me." He shot Avery a look that was more inquisitive than accusatory. "Then along came the two of you."

Again, Avery was at a loss for words. But Ponder was soon lost in more memories from that terrible day long ago, and for a while both men resumed their silence.

Out in the apple orchards, Avery saw JOTUNs—a pair of monstrous pickers large enough to engulf whole trees with their agitating arms. He had overheard Healy arguing with one of his recruits about the exact number of JOTUNs on Harvest. The Corpsman refused to believe there were three JOTUNs for every person—almost a million machines—until the recruit had explained he was counting all the different versions: the smallest aerial crop dusters to the six- wheeled beasts like the ones in the orchard.

"It's funny," Ponder said in a way that made clear he didn't think it was the least bit so. "But at first I missed it: my men, the combat, all of it. Took me years to realize how crazy that was— that I'd been damn lucky to get out when I did. Before things got really bad, and I made a mistake that got a lot more people killed."

Avery nodded his head, although he might as well have said: I know exactly what you mean.

By now the Bifrost had begun to rise before them. They were still an hour away from the limestone escarpment, but squinting his eyes, Avery could just see dark switchbacks carving back and forth across its face that would take them up to Utgard.

On either side of the switchbacks, separated by hundreds of kilometers, were two maglev train lines—thick monorails that angled down from the top of the Bifrost to meet the Ida, far out in the orchards. Avery saw a long train of cargo containers glide down the southern line.

The train seemed to move too quickly for the containers' size, and Avery realized they must be empty—on their way to a depot where hundreds of JOTUNs waited with fresh-picked loads.

"Maybe FLEETCOM decided you needed a break?" Ponder offered.

"Maybe," Avery said. It was as good an explanation as any.

"Well, why not start tonight? Have a drink, dance with a girl."

Avery smiled despite himself. "That an order, sir?"

Ponder laughed and slapped his artificial arm on his thigh.

"Yes, Staff Sergeant. Yes, it is."

By the time Avery pulled the Warthog into the curved drive of Harvest's Parliament building, he knew a lot more about Captain Ponder. How fighting the Insurrection had forced him to miss his eldest son's wedding and the birth of his first grandchild—precious occasions he missed much more than his arm. As they dismounted, buttoned their coats' brass buttons, and pulled on their black-billed dress caps, Avery realized he not only trusted but had a great deal more respect for the man who wore his CO's uniform.

The Parliament's lobby was thick with partygoers: men in pastel, seersucker suits; women in ruffled, scoop neck gowns—fashions that were already out of style in core-world salons, but had only just taken hold of Harvest's provincial high society. Some of the guests gawked and whispered as Avery and Ponder passed. And it struck the Staff Sergeant that they were the first marines—the first soldiers—some of the guests had ever seen.

But as they threaded their way up a crowded granite staircase to the ballroom, some of the curious gazes turned cold. We might be a new sight, Avery grimaced, but not necessarily a welcome one. It seemed the UNSC's handling of the Insurrection wasn't any more popular on Harvest than it was anywhere else.

"Nils Thune," someone bellowed from the landing at the top of the staircase. A thick hand shot out from a great swath of red- and white-striped fabric. "You must be Captain Ponder."

"Governor," Ponder paused on the top step and saluted. Then he extended his hand. "It's an honor to meet you."

"Likewise, of course!" Thune's grip was so strong he practically pulled Ponder up onto the landing.

"May I introduce you to one of my men? Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson."

Thune released Ponder's hand and offered it to Avery. "Well, Johnson?" Thune's red beard parted in a broad, toothsome grin. "What do you think of our planet?"

Avery had a strong grip, but Thune's was immobilizing. His hand possessed the kind of strength one got from years of farming the old-fashioned way—without assistance from a fleet of hulking automatons. Avery guessed correctly that despite his vigor, the Governor was well into his sixties—that he'd been one of the first colonists to land on Harvest. "Reminds me of home, sir." Avery grimaced. "I grew up on Earth, Chicago Industrial Zone."

Thune released Avery's hand and stabbed his thumb happily to his chest. "Minnesota! My mother's and father's side both, far back as I can remember." Widening his smile he ushered the marines toward the doorway of a brightly lit ballroom. "You're in good company, Staff Sergeant. Most everyone around here's from the Midwest—pulled up stakes when the soil went bad. Of course none of us knew just how much better things would be once we got to Harvest!"

The Governor snatched a champagne flute from a passing waiter and downed it in one gulp.

"This way!" He shuffled sideways through the ballroom doorway, his girth doing at least as much to part the crowd as any deference to his office. "And stay close! The show's about to start, and I want you two front and center!"

Avery shot Ponder a confused look. But the Captain simply plunged into Thune's gap.

Avery followed just as the crowd drew back upon itself, practically sucking him into the ballroom. Doing their best not to step on any toes, the marines followed Thune to one of the many glass-paned doors in the ballroom's eastern wall that led to a broad balcony overlooking the Parliament's gardens—and beyond that, Utgard's mall.

Stepping up beside Thune against the balcony's waist-high granite railing, Avery saw that the park was full of revelers. Light-globes tugging at their tethers in the twilight breeze illuminated knots of families sitting on brightly colored picnic blankets. Hardly any of the mall was left uncovered, and Avery was certain the vast majority of the planet's three hundred thousand residents were in attendance. But for what, he still wasn't quite sure.

"Rol!" Thune's shout rang painfully loud in Avery's ears. "Over here!" The Governor waved a hand above his head, but this wasn't necessary. Thune was taller than anyone on the balcony, Avery included, and the mop of thick, red and gray hair that covered his head was impossible to miss. Avery craned his neck toward the ballroom in time to see the Governor's somato-typical opposite slide out from the jostling crowd; a short, balding man whose elderly frame barely filled his light gray linen suit.

"Rol Pedersen," Thune announced. "My Attorney General."

"Just a fancy way to say lawyer." Pedersen smiled modestly through his thin, pursed lips.

He didn't offer Avery or Ponder his hand, but not for any lack of courtesy; the jubilant crowd had begun to flow from the ballroom to the railing, crushing the Attorney General's arms firmly to his sides.

"Rol's about as formal as we get out here," Thune explained. "Stickler for details. He's the one who handled all the negotiations with the CA about us raising a militia."

"Technically." Pedersen's eyes twinkled as he raised one of his white eyebrows. "I formally accepted their demand that we have one."

Just then the sky erupted with fireworks, filling the gaps between the Tiara's seven elevators with multicolored blossoms. Jutting up from Utgard's skyline, the strands shone bronze in Epsilon Indi's failing light. As the showering sparks rippled the air around them, they appeared to vibrate, like plucked strings in a giant's harp.

"Alright, everyone!" Thune roared as the last of the fireworks erupted in a smoky, blue- green cloud. "Get set!" The Governor put his hands to his ears, as did everyone else on the balcony except Avery and Ponder.

"Mass driver," Pedersen explained. "We fire it every solstice."

All at once, the towers around the mall went dark as the city's electrical grid lost power.

There was a bright flash beyond the Tiara's central number-four strand, and a moment later a shockwave hammered the mall, flattening the light globes and sending the picnickers squealing after flying napkins and bowled-over children. On the balcony, women shrieked in gleeful fright as they clutched their billowing dresses; men made a gallant show of uncapping their ears as a sonic boom pealed past the Parliament.

"Hurrah!" Thune shouted, starting a round of applause that echoed a similar outburst from the picnickers on the mall. "Well done, Mack!"

"That's mighty kind, Governor." The AI replied from Thune's COM pad, hidden somewhere in his vast jacket. "I aim to please."

"Speaking of which," Thune said, heading away from the railing. "How close did you come?"

Pedersen freed a hand and pointed after Thune, letting the two marines know they were expected to follow. This time the Governor led them to the far end of the ballroom where a group of children—girls with satin bows on their dresses and boys in shiny vests and shoes— packed tight around a circular table topped with a cornucopia of fruits and vegetables. A silver holo-projector was centered in a wreath of leafy vines and deep purple grape clusters. On top of that stood Mack.

"Missed by a mile," the AI said, rubbing the back of its neck with a grimy handkerchief.

"Actually, more like fifty kilometers. But I'm sure she'll say something."

"No doubt. No doubt," Thune chuckled. "Listen, I'd like you to meet Captain Ponder and Staff Sergeant Johnson. UNSC Marines. Here to raise a militia."

"Mack. Agricultural operations." Mack touched the brim of his cowboy hat. Then, nodding toward the balcony and the mass driver somewhere beyond, "Same as the navy's big guns. Just a little less kick."

"You know," Ponder deadpanned, "there's a reason we only fire those in space."

Mass drivers were a relatively simple, cheap solution for boosting objects from a planet's surface into orbit. Typically built on large, flexible gimbles, their linked, magnetic loops could be charged, aimed, and fired with very little automation—with a simple computer rather than an AI. But drivers had one major disadvantage: limited throw-weight. Which meant that while Harvest's driver worked well during the first decade after the colony's founding (when its primary role was to send carefully packaged nuclear waste on a collision course with Epsilon Indi), for the planet to meet its full export potential, it needed to be replaced with a high- capacity lift system such as the Tiara.

Driver technology was alive and well in the navy, however, in the form of Mass Accelerator Cannon. So-called MAC frigates and cruisers were basically moveable mass drivers—ships designed around the weapons' long, electromagnetic coils. The technology was similar to that of the M99 Stanchion rifle. But whereas the M99's light, semi-ferrous rounds were only a few millimeters long, a MAC slug was more than ten meters end-to-end, weighed one-hundred- sixty metric tons, and packed enough punch to penetrate the navy's thickest Titanium-A armor plate.

"Space?" Thune grumbled dismissively. "Those things even make noise in zero-gee?"

"If you're inside a MAC ship when the cannon fires?" Ponder raised his hands wide around his head, simulating a deafening boom. "I don't know if you're a religious man, Governor. But it's a little like a church bell—"

"Am I?" The Governor beamed. "Lutheran! Born and raised!"

Pedersen sighed in mock protest. "If had known you were going to bring up religion, Captain—as Attorney General—I would have counseled a less contentious topic."

"And I was about to tell a story …" Mack added, loud enough for all the children to hear.

The young crowd cheered as a holographic representation of a bustling, Wild West main street appeared behind Mack. A group of masked outlaws rushed from a bank, firing their six- shooters and spooking the horses of a passing stagecoach. The children oohed and ahhed. Mack pulled a sheriff's star out of his hip pocket and pinned it to his chest. "Might want to take the sermon to the saloon."

"Fine by me," Thune said, clapping Ponder on the shoulder. "Captain?"

Ponder stood firm under the force of Thune's blow. "After you, Governor." Before he followed Thune to the ballroom's bar, he asked Pedersen, "I gave my Staff Sergeant strict orders to find himself a dance partner. Know anyone who might fit the bill?"

Pedersen raised an eager finger. "I have just the one!"

"I certainly appreciate it," Ponder said. Then to Avery with a smile: "Good luck, marine."

Before Avery could respond, the Captain turned on his heels, and Avery felt Pedersen's light touch on his elbow. "Do you know about the driver incident?" the Attorney General asked, leading Avery away from the first shots of Mack's gunfight and the delighted squeals of the children.

"Incident, sir?"

"The thing between Mack and Sif?"

"No."

"Well …"

Pedersen proceeded to explain how, not long after the DCS installed Sif in the Tiara, there had been a critical failure in her data center's power supply. This forced her technicians to stop all activity on her strands or risk a load-imbalance that would have collapsed the entire system.

It had been a serious crisis, and Mack decided to solve it by using the driver to boost a new power supply into orbit.

Trying to be as helpful as possible, he shot the component right into the Tiara's number-four coupling station. It was an incredible accomplishment. But when Sif's technicians restored her power and she learned what Mack had done—how he could have easily obliterated her data- center—Sif had not been amused.

"That's why she isn't here tonight," Pedersen concluded as they stepped out of the ballroom and headed for the balcony's calm northeast corner. "Why she always comes up with a polite excuse not to attend any celebration that involves a driver shot. It's too bad really. I think she could use a bit of fun."

"That's quite an indictment, Your Honor." A woman's voice rang out from the railing, bringing Pedersen to a hasty stop. But Avery had already noticed the woman many paces back —seen how her diaphanous silver shawl covered only part of her bare back. He slowed his pace to give himself time to remove his dress-cap and smooth his burr of hair.

"My apologies, Ms. al-Cygni," the Attorney General replied. "But I was talking about Sif.

The incident with the driver."

"Of course." Jilan pushed away from the railing, and turned to face the Attorney General.

"If I remember correctly, my department mandated that you shut the driver down."

"As I recall, we rejected that mandate on the grounds that it was in breach of the CA charter —a serious infringement on our already limited sovereignty." The Attorney General winked.

"But off the record, how could we possibly have given up such spectacular entertainment?"

Jilan laughed. "I won't argue with that."

"I'm sorry," Pedersen said hastily. "Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson? Representative Jilan al- Cygni, DCS."

Jilan offered her hand. Avery hesitated.

If she had been wearing a bland DCS uniform, he would have known what to do: take her hand and shake it. But her floor-length silver gown tripped him up. With its empire waist and halter top, she was the very picture of core-world vogue. Her black hair was slicked back close to her scalp and tucked behind her ears, and stayed perfectly still even as a fresh breeze from the mall caught her shawl and rustled it from her soft brown shoulders.

"Kissing is for politicians," Jilan said, catching her shawl in her elbows. "And I'm certainly not that."

So Avery shook. Her grip wasn't as strong as the Governor's, but not as delicate as her slender arms suggested.

"If you'll excuse me," Pedersen coughed and patted his chest. "I need to rescue this marine's commanding officer from a riveting discussion on the trajectory of his immortal soul."

Jilan smiled. "Do give my best to the Governor."

Pedersen brought his heels together, and turned back to the ballroom. Jilan waited for him to disappear into the crowd—until she and Avery were alone—before she spoke.

"I'd tell you to relax. But you don't seem the type."

Avery didn't know how to respond to that. But he was given a moment's reprieve thanks to a dancing couple that bumped him in the back then spun away, giggling apologetically. The string quartet had begun a livelier second set. Those guests who hadn't gone indoors to freshen their drinks after the fireworks were now abandoning their idle conversations for the more alluring language of waltz.

Jilan retrieved a small, clamshell purse dangling from one of her wrists. It was covered with tiny mirrors shaped like fish scales that dazzled Avery's gaze. "48789-20114-AJ," she said, pulling a COM-pad from the purse, and reading from its screen. "That is your serial number, correct?"

Avery's eyes refocused. "Yes, ma'am." Suddenly her smile didn't seem so sweet.

"Team-leader, ORION detachment, NavSpecWar division?"

"With respect, ma'am. That's classified."

"I know."

Avery felt moisture start to pool under his arms. "How can I help you, ma'am?"

"Innies are attacking freighters. Destroying cargo, killing crew. I need you to stop them."

"I'm a drill instructor. Colonial Militia. Find someone else."

Jilan drew her shawl back onto her shoulders. "You were AWOL in Chicago," she said matter-of-factly. "And under investigation for possible gross misconduct."

Avery clenched his jaw. "I was cleared of—"

"Given your status, didn't you think it was odd that FLEET-COM would approve your request for transfer?"

Avery narrowed his eyes in an intimidating stare. "I'll tell you what's odd. Someone from DCS with access to my file—you talking to me like you're my CO."

Jilan raised her COM-pad and turned it so Avery could see her ID picture glowing on its screen.

In her official UNSC uniform, Avery thought she looked as beautiful as she did in her gown. But only in the way he considered a well-maintained weapon beautiful—clean, locked tight, and ready to inflict deadly force. A text stamp below her picture clarified her true rank and departmental affiliation: Lieutenant Commander, ONI Section Three.

"As of now, I am your commanding officer," Jilan shut off her pad. "You can check your attitude, Staff Sergeant, and start following orders. Or I will arrange for your immediate transfer back to TREBUCHET." There was no anger in her voice, just calm determination. "Do I make myself clear?"

Avery choked on a slowly building rage. At last, he knew exactly why he had come to Harvest, as well as who had brought him here. "Yes, ma'am."

Al-Cygni dropped her COM into her purse and snapped it shut. "Wait for me downstairs.

As soon I can collect Staff Sergeant Byrne, we'll be shipping out." Dress rippling behind her, she stepped quickly into the waltzing crowd.

CHAPTER EIGHT

MINOR TRANSGRESSION, RELIQUARY ORBITAL

PATH

There would be no surprises this time. Chur'R-Yar had made sure of that. Through the walls of the umbilical, she could see the boxy freighter's atmosphere venting out the careful holes she'd made with her own ship's lasers. If any of the aliens were hiding on board, the Shipmistress had done all she could to kill them without harming whatever relic lay inside.

After the surprise encounter on the last freighter, Chur'R-Yar and the other Kig-Yar had scoured the alien ship. But they found no relics. Even Minor Transgression's Luminary had given up and dimmed its glyph. In her frustration, the Shipmistress decided to destroy the vessel—obliterate all evidence of her fruitless transgression.

She had considered ordering the Huragok to conduct a more meticulous search. But as fast as the creature worked, she didn't want to remain in the same place for very long in case the alien it had killed had somehow managed to call for help without triggering her ship's sensors.

And besides, the Deacon (her only means of communicating with the Huragok) was an emotional wreck—totally useless after his close call. As infuriating as his cowardice was, Chur'R-Yar had let him malinger in the methane suite. She needed her crew focused on the task at hand, not distracted by new and interesting ways to torment the Deacon.

"Ready yourselves!" the Shipmistress clattered as the umbilical finished its burn through the vessel's hull. Zhar and the two other male Kig-Yar were bunched together before her, as close as their pressure suits allowed. Built for external maintenance rather than combat, the suits were bulky and unwieldy—a necessary inconvenience given the lack of breathable air inside the freighter. Chur'R-Yar knew her crewmen were uncomfortable, Zhar especially. The suits' helmets didn't allow the male's spiny combs much room to flex, and her chosen mate was fully flushed—eager to prove his worth.

The umbilical ceased its fractional forward movement, and Zhar's head twitched sideways as he checked to make sure the seal was secure. "After me!" he clacked. Gloved claws wrapped tight around his crystal cutlass, he sprang through the wavering energy barrier that served as the umbilical's airlock. The Ship-mistress gripped her plasma-pistol tight and followed the other males through.

The first thing Chur'R-Yar noticed inside the hold was the lack of gravity. Floating half her height above the floor, she realized her laser fire must have hit an essential part. She rattled her teeth with annoyance as she watched Zhar and the others work to find purchase on the floor's grooved metal panels. The crewmen had been overeager. Now they were scrambling about like fools in the mocking glare of the hold's red emergency lights.

"Calm yourselves!" the Shipmistress hissed into her helmet's signal unit. Then, as she secured herself on the umbilical's protruding tip, "Move toward the boxes!"

The hold was filled with the same plastic containers as the first freighter, though it wasn't nearly as tightly packed. The boxes were stacked in low piles, spaced evenly apart. It would take time to search each one, especially in zero gravity. Chur'R-Yar hissed angrily to herself; the best way to speed the process was to get the Deacon to instruct the Huragok to find and fix the anti-grav unit she had unintentionally destroyed.

But just as she twisted around to head back through the energy barrier, she felt something sharp and hot tear through the neck of her pressure suit, slicing her scaly skin—felt the vibration of more projectiles ricochet off the hold's wall. Her suit automatically closed around the two small punctures, venting some of her violet blood in a globular spray. "Retreat!" she shouted to her crew, "Back to the ship!" The Ship-mistress didn't know her attacker's location, but she knew it had her firmly in its sights. Without looking to see if Zhar and the others were in any position to follow, she thrust herself back inside the umbilical.

Avery had to hand it to Lt. Commander al-Cygni. The woman could plan an op. Her carefully disguised sloop, Walk of Shame, had been filled with a small arsenal of weapons, some of which Avery had never seen before. He and Byrne had both selected what al-Cygni referred to as a battle rifle, a prototype long-barreled weapon with an optical scope. The two Staff Sergeants had thought the rifle's combination of range and accuracy would be a good fit for the long sight lines between the stacks of boxes in the cargo container.

But that was before they knew they were going to end up floating high above the container's floor.

When the freighter had been shot through with lasers and lost its gravity, Avery and Byrne had been shocked to say the least. Fortunately, the Lt. Commander had outfitted them with bulky black vacuum-suits and helmets with clear visors. When the bright tip of some sort of boring device punched through the hull, the two Staff Sergeants had pushed off from their hiding places behind the boxes for the marginally better cover of the metal supports girding the freighter's upper hull.

Avery firmed his grip on his battle rifle's trigger. The cross hairs in the weapon's scope were locked on the fourth alien, just now emerging from the shimmering field. Yes, the Lt.

Commander could plan an op, he thought. But she hadn't planned for this.

In their premission briefing in an empty Welcome Wagon from Utgard up to the Tiara, al- Cygni had told Avery and Byrne about a recent Insurrectionist victory in Epsilon Eridanus— one they hadn't been informed of, even with their top-level clearances.

About the same time as the two Staff Sergeants were struggling to take down the bomber in the restaurant on Tribute, the Innies had hit the luxury liner National Holiday as it waited above the planet Reach. The ship was just completing its load-in of more than fifteen hundred civilian passengers on charter-tour to Arcadia—a colony famous for its recreational amenities—when the pair of unmanned orbital taxis struck.

The liner's captain had assumed the taxis were simply carrying late-arriving passengers.

When they failed to comply with his docking commands, the captain had initiated evasive maneuvers—tried to deflect what he thought would be minor impacts. But the amount of explosives the Innies had packed into the taxis not only tore National Holiday in two, but also burned away the hull paint of every other ship in a two-kilometer radius.

The two Staff Sergeants had listened soberly to a recording on Jilan's COM-pad of the captain's final words—heard how the former naval fighter pilot had calmly directed other ships out of his crippled liner's path, even as it dropped into Reach's atmosphere, bodies billowing from its breached staterooms, and began to burn.

So far, Jilan had explained, ONI had managed to keep things under wraps, successfully spinning the Innie's hit as a tragic accident. Partly this was because the attack was so audacious.

This was the first time the Insurrectionists had hit a non-terrestrial target—and not only that, but they'd done it above Reach, the epicenter of UNSC power in Epsilon Eridanus. Even though the Innies claimed responsibility for the horrible loss of life, most people were too fearful to believe the rebels' claim. If they could lash out in plain view of the UNSC fleet, what was stopping them from hitting targets in other systems? Sol, for example, or Harvest?

According to Jilan, FLEETCOM had made it crystal clear there could be no more National Holidays. ONI went on high alert, and as soon as Section Three got word of a freighter missing in Epsilon Indi, they'd authorized her to conduct a covert investigation. Just in case she needed to take exceptional action, al-Cygni's superiors had ordered her to recruit Avery and Byrne.

"Ma'am, we've got hostiles in the hold," Avery whispered into his helmet mic.

"Take them out." Al-Cygni's reply was curt. Avery was supposed to maintain radio silence.

"They aren't Innies."

"Clarify."

Avery took a deep breath. "They're aliens." He watched as the first three creatures that had come barreling through the barrier struggled to get hand- and footholds—studied their long, bony beaks and large, bloodshot eyes through their clear helmets. "Kind of like lizards without the tails."

There was a pause as Jilan, holding station in Walk of Shame some two hundred kilometers distant from the freighter, considered Avery's words. But the Staff Sergeant knew it wouldn't be long before one of the aliens looked up and saw them lurking in the shadows between the beams.

"Ma'am, I need orders," Avery persisted.

"Try and take one alive," al-Cygni replied. "But don't let any escape, over."

"Roger that." Avery hugged his battle rifle close. He hadn't had time to fire the weapon. He hoped its nine-point-five-millimeter high-penetration rounds would be sufficient to puncture the aliens' iridescent suits.

"Byrne, get set." Avery glanced at the other Staff Sergeant, positioned between a pair of beams to his left. "I'm firing on the leader." He assumed the leader was the alien nearest the shimmering hole in the hull. It seemed more composed than the others, and also carried an obvious weapon: a silver, C-shaped pistol with green energy glowing between its tips. Avery hoped taking down the leader would make the other aliens—now splayed firmly on the floor— more eager to surrender. He took a breath and fired.

In zero gravity, the recoil from the battle rifle's three-round burst was more pronounced than Avery had anticipated. Two of his shots went wide, and, as the recoil slammed him back against the hull, he watched his wounded target disappear back through the glowing barrier.

Avery cursed himself for not bracing more firmly against the beams. But this was his first experience with zero-gee combat. He could only hope the aliens were similarly inexperienced.

So far, this didn't look to be the case.

Avery did his best to steady his aim as the three remaining aliens pushed off from the floor and rocketed toward him in a loose triangular formation. The one in the lead had a bigger helmet, and Avery could see through his scope that it also had the longest spines—fleshy red spikes compressed against its head. But Byrne had acquired the same target. He fired first, and sent the alien spinning to Avery's right.

Avery didn't have time to adjust his aim before one of the trailing aliens slammed into him, slashing with some sort of crystal knife. He parried the knife with the barrel of his rifle as their helmets cracked together. Avery's helmet began to shake, and for a moment he thought the visor was about to shatter. Then he looked the alien square in the face and realized the vibrations were simply the transference of the creature's silent, livid scream.

Avery had pinned the creature's knife against one of the beams. The weapon was energized —gleamed with internal pink fire. He was certain it would make short work of his vacuum-suit, not to mention the flesh beneath.

With its free hand, the alien began clawing at Avery's neck and shoulders. But its gloves were bulky and it couldn't do any real damage. Avery reached down and unholstered an M6 pistol he'd selected from al-Cygni's arsenal. Before the alien could react, he put four quick rounds into the underside of its elongated helmet, near the base of its bony jaws. The alien's head burst apart, painting the inside of its helmet a very vivid violet.

Avery pushed the alien back down toward the floor of the container as Byrne opened fire to his left. But Byrne was also having difficulty recovering from his first shot, and the third alien hit him right in the gut, knocking his battle rifle loose. As the weapon rebounded off the hull and went spinning out of reach, the alien drove its knife into Byrne's left thigh.

The alien must have thought it only needed to puncture Byrne's suit in order to kill him, and it might have succeeded were it not for the suit's compartmentalized design. As Byrne pulled the knife from his leg, the hole filled with yellow sealant foam. The alien flailed its arms— Avery thought to try and drive the knife back in. But as the weapon began to pulse with rosy light, he realized the creature was actually trying to escape an impending detonation.

"Lose the blade!" Avery shouted. "It's gonna blow!"

Byrne sunk the knife into the alien's mid-section and kicked it back the way it had come.

The creature pulled frantically at the blade, but Byrne had driven it too deep. A split-second later it blew apart in a bright pink flash. Tiny, wet shards flecked Avery's visor like slushy snow.

"Thanks," Byrne grunted over the COM. "But I'd put a few more in that one if I were you."

Avery looked to his right. The first alien Byrne had shot had managed to wrap an arm around a cross-brace farther down the ceiling and stop its lateral motion. The thing had its head cocked in Avery's direction, and was staring at him with one unblinking eye. Byrne's burst had caught its free arm below the shoulder, but the alien had managed to keep hold of its knife and was preparing to make a throw.

Avery put the creature's torso square in his pistol's V-shaped iron sights. He could see its fleshy spines engorge with dark blood. The alien opened its jaws, baring razor-sharp teeth.

"Nice to meet you too," Avery frowned. Then he emptied the M6's twelve-round clip into the center of alien's chest. The impacts unhooked its arm and sent it tumbling toward the far end of the cargo-container.

"I'm going after the other one." Avery planted his boots firmly against the hull.

"I'll back you up," Byrne volunteered.

Avery shot Byrne a serious stare. "If that blade sliced an artery, the foam isn't gonna hold.

Stay put. I'll be right back." With that, he pushed off toward the barrier.

"Johnson," Jilan said. "You've got ten minutes."

Avery completed her sentence: before I shoot the alien ship with you in it. He knew Walk of Shame was equipped with a single Archer missile—a ship-to-ship weapon capable of crippling all but the largest vessels in the human fleet. The Lt. Commander had told him she would use it to shoot what they had all thought would be an Insurrectionist ship if it tried to escape. Avery knew it would be even more important to stop the alien ship. For if it got away, it would almost certainly return with reinforcements.

"If I'm not back in five," Avery replied, "I'm not coming back." Then he passed through the barrier.

Avery wasn't expecting gravity, but he managed to perform an ugly duck-and-roll and rise up with his rifle at the ready. Aiming straight down the semitransparent tube, he could see the full hooked profile of the alien ship. Avery tried not to think about how many more of the aliens might be on board. There was no cover inside the umbilical, and if the creatures poured into the tube, he would be a goner. Avery fast-walked forward and a few moments later, he was posting beside another fluctuating field.

As far as Avery could tell, the first barrier hadn't done him any harm, though he couldn't say the same for his COM. He tried to contact Byrne and al-Cygni, but their secure channel was all static. All alone against an alien ship, Avery thought, taking a few calming breaths. He knew if he thought about the situation any longer he would lose his initiative and quite possibly his nerve. Weapon shouldered, he stepped through the second barrier. This time he noticed his skin tingle—felt the field compressing the flexible fabric of his suit.

A short passage beyond led to a wider corridor bathed in purple light. Avery scanned left and counted twenty meters to a bulkhead. He noted recessed doors spaced every five meters along the way—sealed compartments, but for what Avery could only guess. He scanned right and saw what appeared to be a giant worm tied to a bunch of dirty pink balloons turn a corner at the end of the corridor. A different kind of alien? Avery wondered.

Suddenly he saw movement to his left. As he leapt across the corridor into one of the recessed doorways, plasma scorched the air behind him. Turning around, he watched a salvo of searing green bolts rake across the corridor. The metal boiled and buckled like the shells of beetles trapped on a burning log.

Avery wasn't about to stick his head out. Instead he angled his battle rifle around the corner of the alcove and fired until the sixty-round magazine was dry. The hostile fire had stopped.

Avery hoped he'd hit his target, not just driven it into cover.

Of course, there was only one way to find out. He pulled his rifle back and swapped magazines. Then he counted to three and pivoted into the corridor.

The first place Chur'R-Yar went was the bridge. From there she could disconnect the umbilical and power up her ship's engine—escape before any of her attackers came on board.

But as she pulled off her helmet and removed her awkward gloves, she realized all her plans were scuttled.

The air inside the bridge was ripe with the Huragok's gaseous emissions, and the circuits connecting the Luminary to Minor Transgression's signal circuits had been repaired. As she stalked toward the pyramidal device, she saw it was transferring a full report of all the alien world's relics back to the Ministry of Tranquility.

"Deacon," she hissed. "Traitor."

But oddly enough, at this moment of betrayal, the first thing Chur'R-Yar felt was sadness.

She had come so close to her prize that she could almost feel the soft walls of her nest—the warm clutch of eggs beneath her legs and the little Kig-Yar growing inside that would have carried on her bloodline. She enjoyed these imagined sensations until she was overwhelmed with a desire for revenge.

When the methane suite proved empty, Chur'R-Yar knew there was only one other place the Unggoy could be: Minor Transgression's escape-pod. But as she exited the suite and saw the black-suited alien emerge from the passage leading to the umbilical, the Shipmistress realized, to her extreme disappointment, that even vengeance might be beyond her grasp.

If the alien was aboard her ship, her crewmen were dead. With their help, she might have been able to fight past the alien to the pod in her ship's stern. Now her success depended on her own speed and cunning. But these were much reduced.

The calluses across her shoulders were now so stiff that she had a difficult time bringing her plasma-pistol to bear. By the time she had it up and firing the alien had dived for cover. As she considered how best to drive the alien back into the open, she saw fiery flashes. Projectiles tore through her abdomen and clipped her spine. Another shot shattered her left knee, but by then she no longer had any feeling below the waist. Blood leaking from holes her overtaxed suit could only partially fill, she slumped sideways against the corridor wall.

The Shipmistress' hands felt impossibly heavy, but she managed to raise her pistol into her lap and check its charge. Less than a third of its energy remained—not enough to stop the alien when it came out of hiding, but enough to do what needed to be done.

She reached up and palmed the switch to the methane suite's airlock. As its outer door slid open, she used what was left of her strength to aim her pistol and depress its trigger. As the weapon built up a powerful overcharged bolt sufficient to burn through the airlock's inner door, more projectiles tore through her chest, knocking her back onto the floor.

The light above the Shipmistress dimmed as the alien approached. But despite the spasms wracking her arm, she waited to release the trigger until the thing looked into her eyes. She watched it glance from her weapon to the airlock. She waited until it flinched—an indication it understood the fate she had chosen for it.

"This is my ship." Chur'R-Yar hissed. "And I shall do with it what I wish." Her claw slid off the trigger, and a bright green ball of plasma hit the inner door with a sizzling crack.

As the bolt penetrated the suite, it ignited the ambient methane, starting a chain reaction that quickly claimed the tank recharge-station imbedded in the suite's wall. The alien scrambled back toward the umbilical, but the station's compressor exploded into the corridor, knocking its helmeted head against the opposite side of the passage. The alien fell to the floor unconscious.

Chur'R-Yar's tongue flicked weakly against her teeth. A measure of vengeance, at least. As the last of her blood pumped out of her body, the methane suite's ruined airlock burst open and a roiling fireball consumed her.

Dadab felt the blast before he heard it—a sudden tremor inside the escape pod followed by a muffled boom. He whined with terror as a series of small explosions rocked the pod in its cradle. What was keeping the Huragok? The Deacon had been very clear that they had barely any time to execute their plan.

When all the Kig-Yar were in the umbilical, Dadab had trotted out of the methane-suite with a spare tank, while Lighter Than Some headed to the bridge with his true accounting of the Luminations and his explanation of Chur'R-Yar's heresy. But before Dadab could return for another tank, he heard the Shipmistress' warning to her crew over his signal unit, and had remained holed up in the pod.

Now he heard a whistle of air in the circular shaft connecting the pod to Minor Transgression's main corridor and knew the ship was venting atmosphere. He didn't want to leave the Huragok behind, but he would have to close the pod's hatch or risk explosive decompression.

The whistling came to an abrupt stop as Lighter Than Some dropped down the shaft and squeezed into the pod. < Is something wrong? > the Huragok asked, catching sight of the Deacon's panicked gaze.

< You, late! > Dadab signed, slamming his fist on the pod's command-console to close the hatch.

< Well, we couldn't have gone anywhere without these.

> Dadab groaned as Lighter Than Some revealed the cause of its delay—the luggage it had stopped to retrieve from the methane suite. In its tentacles it held all three of the intelligent boxes, two from the freighter's command cabins and one from the giant machine in the second freighter's hold.
