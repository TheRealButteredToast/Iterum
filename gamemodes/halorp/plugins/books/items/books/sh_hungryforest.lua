<h1>The Hungry Forest</h1>
<p>
Not too long ago there once was a young boy. Every morning after his studies he would rush along the highways to what we now call the Badlands. 

One day he stumbled upon a crimson root rearing its upper half above the cold ground.

He stopped and stared, wondering what it was. From his backpack he drew a safety knife, and placed his hand on the root to guide his blade.

Yet, when his hand met the root he froze. The warm, gushing root pulsed at the touch.

He drew back, an innate sense of dread overcame him. He felt cold, numb, and cried out.

Seconds past, and suddenly, darkness.

Once he came too, he looked around the room in distress. Eerily his eyes panned the walls for anything familiar.

In a moment his eyes locked with a blury figure staring back at him.

His vision cleared, and in a sigh of relief he recognized the piercing stares from his family.

No one knows what was discussed, only that the next day he returned to the root. 

This time, he had an axe. Once he reached the root, cleared enough dirt off the top to strike, and raised his axe.

He struck down with all his might and the blade slashed through the root with one fell swoop.

The cold blade struck true and the root was severed, and with the act a distant cry rang through the air.

Dread once again reared its ugly face.

However, this time, he was far too determined the bring back at least a sample.

Once again he raised his axe, and down the blade sliced the air.

The blade struck the root, and with that second slice a sizeable portion was free from the root.

The boy reached down, and slowly touched the root with his hands.

A warm, pulsing feeling greeted his worn hands.

He adjusted his grip, and pulled the root from the ground.

A distant cry roared through the forest, but this time, it was closer.

Dread became overwhelming. A total desire to flee overcame him, and with his prized sample, he did not resist.

He rushed home, in such a flurry and flight that the furious night could not keep up with him.

Upon returning, he smuggled the root through the lobby and onto his floor.

With the closing of the steel door, he stared out over the city center as the bright yellow beacon mingled with the bring red light of the building facade.

The balcony's views were not the best, but the were a welcome and assuring sign after the cries deep effect.

He marveled under the night sky, as the glittering stars pranced among the skyline, but the fleshy root seemed to rustle his tight bag.

His conscious mind was immediately brough to its irresistable attention. He sought a solution, and he was not left emptyhanded.

He went down the elevator and into the market place, rushed to his well known vendor, and purchased a deep pot.

Assisted by some friendly neighbors, he lugged the pot to the the baclony.

Without regard for permission, he bolted the pot to the balcony's metal floor, and took out the pulsing root and buried it deep.

Days passed, and he would obsessively water the pot.

Weeks passed, and he saw no above surface growth.

Finally a month passed, and he worried he had killed his posession.

He took a blunt gardening shovel and dug up his root, only to see it had slightly expanded. Rather upset with its measly growth, he threw the spade into the root.

The metal spade dug deep, but the root was not bothered. It molded to the spades shape, and ascended the metalic surface.

His eyes watered at the sight, the smell was putrid and nauseating. The smell overwhelmed him, but in its disgust it evoked something more.

Visions overcame him, he saw vast empires crumble, endless waves of men slaughtered, flesh consumed and torn asunder.

He slept for a whole day, then no more. He would roll and roll, toss and turn, but his eyes would never rest. 

Whenever he closed his eyes a face would stare back. The abyss had awakened within and there was no going back.

His mind was increasingly not his own, his sight would lie to him, his ears deceive him. 

Many times a day he would be lieing in bed, and come to only to see he was holding raw meat.

His delusions grew and his paranoia with it. He came to believe someone was coming for him, forever watching him. 

He clawed as his skin, only his will holding him back from many catastrophes.

One day, he came too and he was too late. Before him a sizeable chunk of meat was placed onto contact with the root.

He could do no more than watch the root devour the meat in such a horrific fashion that he passed out.

The next time he came too, he estimated, by analyzing his spending bills, that he had placed half a ton of raw meat into the pot over the span of a week. 

He decided it was time to end the madness. He made an appointment with the local clinic. But before he could heal, he must first remove the bullet stuck in his flesh.

He had long realized the pot had grown too heavy to move, and he struggled to life the root thanks to the generously donated meals.

As such, he slid the ceramic pot along the metal surface to the parking garage, and with a rented truck he brought it back to the forest from whence it came.

He looked about him and the forest had hardly changed, he wondered how long it had been since he last was there, but time meant nothing to him now.

He took the spade, and, after staring at it for almost half an hour in a trance like state, began to excavate the root.

He could not find it, until he saw a thin tendon sprout from his fresh excavation. He looked upon it in amazement, until it looked back.

He froze, his body petrified by fear. Dread returned, and a distant cry thundered through the valley.

The distant roar of the dam's flowing wateres paled in its hopeless competiton.

With the flash of lightning and the rumble of thunder, some figure emerged from the pot's dirt.

The boy was pounced upon, and never again to be seen.

An eerie figure lurked home. Dragging its feet, drenched in blood and a curious color. His neck was permanently on an angle, and his thoughts unbearable.

In the cold, dark night, he returned to his beloved balcony, but this time dread did not leave him be.

Thoughts of horror, thoughts of truth, thoughts of what is and what must be flooded over him.

The prancing stars burned his pale flesh and rotted his shredded skin.

His mind would not leave him to his own, he was never again to be alone.

He stared upon the faint stars, oh how faint they seemed to grow.

The stars turned black, and the moon turned red. The air turned orange, and the distant waves turned to wretched screams.

Damnation was upon him, and he knew it too well.

Horror, and a leap.

Flying, and a crash.

Silence, and a roar.

A local homeless man was sleeping in an alley across the street, when a wretched howl rung through the metal city. The impactful thud drew him near, but the stench made him distant.

The boys body was torn, held by bone and rotten flesh, his head had tumors and lumps, he was mishapen, if he had any shape at all.

The homeless man began to wonder how this could happen, he closed his eyes to shield his mind from the tormenting sight.

Until he hear a shuffle, the ruffling of leather and cotton. He opened them, to his dismay. The boy's body rose from the concrete, and suddenly one of his flailing appendages struck the man.

The man was knocked out cold, and his body was dragged into an alley. The cameras could see no more.

Police searches began, the UNSC and UEG sent patrol teams, and even reports of an ONI investigation circled the city. 

Nothing was ever found. To this day the death of Alexander Retreson remains a mystery. A warrant is out for his arrest, charged with Murder of the First Degree.

Legend has it that shadowy figures that lurk the Asphodelian alleys are him, but no one has ever been brave enough to confirm the tale. All formal expeditions and searches have long ceased.

But Alexander's rotten heart still beats, and with that fact alone, the Hungry Forest gets its feed.
